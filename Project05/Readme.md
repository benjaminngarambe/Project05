#  Skynet Revolution - Episode 1
The Goal

Your virus has caused a backdoor to open on the Skynet network enabling you to send new instructions in real time.

You decide to take action by stopping Skynet from communicating on its own internal network.

Your mission is to reprogram the virus so it will sever links in such a way that the Skynet Agent is unable to access another sub-network thus preventing information concerning the presence of our virus to reach Skynet's central hub.
## Rules
For each test you are given:
<ul>
<li>A map of the network.</li>
<li>The position of the exit gateways.</li>
<li>The starting position of the Skynet agent.</li>
</ul>

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update the tests as appropriate.
